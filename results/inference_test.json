It iterates over the dataset, analyzes each image according to its classification, and updates the count of normal and abnormal cats accordingly.\n\nPlease replace `'your_dataset'` with the actual name of your dataset file. This script assumes that the dataset contains two types of images - 'normal' and 'abnormal'. Adjustments may be needed if the data format is different or additional features are present in the dataset.\n\nThe output will provide details about the number of normal and abnormal cats among those seen in the dataset. For example, if there were 50 normal cats and 20",
